    text: "A brief summary of my experience with Travel Monk Adventures. This is my honest review. I wanted to go to India for 51 days, starting with a Ladakh portion but then winding with train and bus down the subcontinent, through Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, and all the way to Kanyakumari. From north to south. This was the biggest solo trip I had ever taken. Add to that that I was carrying medicine that needed refrigerated storage, even in India in June. Sourabh made an itinerary with me, ensuring that the stays - ranging from lakeside tents to hotels with heated pools - all had the necessary facilities, that transportation was reliable and there were appropriate rest days, and that it fit in my budget. This process was collaborative and helpful, responses in this time period were sometimes delayed but never dangerously so.",

We came to know about travel monk from our friend KK, who went to a ladakh trip last year organized by them. We thank Sourabh verma for his dedication to plan and follow up the trip, and proper guidance.From the outset, travel monk adventures demonstrated professionalism and dedication, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience.",

Starting from preparing our itinerary, which also had some customizations, to arranging our airport pickup, the permits, the stays everything was perfect. The stays were very good and the car provided was in it's best condition. Thanks for making our trip so comfortable!",
