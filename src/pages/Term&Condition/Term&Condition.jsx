        <p>
          The purchase of any travel services offered by Travel Monk Adventures
          (hereinafter referred as ‘First Party’) constitutes a contractual
          arrangement between First Party and Client (hereinafter referred as
          ‘You’) (‘Second Party’). Both Parties are hereinafter referred as
          (‘Parties’). Booking of services with Travel Monk Adventures

          and all the travel companions booked by you.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Trekking, Peak climbing, and mountaineering in the Himalayan region
          carry an inherent risk to life and property of both Parties. Weather

          Party's control. First Party does its best to reduce all types of
          risks, discomfort, and hazard to the best of their ability (within
          financial constraints), yet there are chances of accidents, mishaps,
          and deficiency in service. Ergo, you must agree with these terms and
          conditions. Please ensure that you read carefully and understand
          these terms prior to confirming your booking.

        <p>
          Travel Monk Adventures offers trip(s) and trek(s) that require varied
          levels of fitness. The level of difficulty can be based on the extent
          of physical stress, the terrain, weather, and/or climate. The degree
          of difficulty for some trips can be physically demanding. To enable
          you to choose appropriately and prepare accordingly, carefully review
          the level of difficulty of each trip before booking the same.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Travel Monk Adventures is not a medical expert(s), and it is your
          responsibility to obtain medical advice, latest health requirements,
          including inoculations and vaccines before you join a trip. First
          Party takes no responsibility for your inability to cope with the
          level of difficulty on a trip. While most treks do not require
          specific preparation, a reasonable level of fitness adds to your
          experience. The onus of being fit, healthy, and in shape before
          getting on the trip rests with you.
